*My part is to Classify and predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis**, down the line I built a **Support Vector Machine** and used **Radial Basis Function Kernel** to predict how many patients has heart disease. I used **Principal Component Analysis** to reduce the dimensionality of dataset and perform **PCA graph** where classification of Heart Disease patients can be seen.*
